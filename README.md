# OCTA-Tag-System
This is a universal tag system aimed at the integration of general learning, technology, medicine and GTD (Getting Things Done) system. It can be used **across multiple applications and platforms** (e.g., OmniFocus, Evernote, Toggl, Anki, etc.) with the Tag Function.

In addition, it can work as a glossary.

The repository provides .csv files, which can be directly imported in some applications.
